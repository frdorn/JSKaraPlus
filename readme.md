# JavaScriptKaraPlus



JavaScriptKaraPlus aims to teach students fundamental ideas of programming. I use this tool in my coding lessons in a school in Neckargem√ºnd, Germany

Kara is like [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban). It is very popular in [German speaking countries](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_(Programmierumgebung)) to teach students how to program. JavaScriptKara reimplements [JavaScriptKara from swisseduc.ch](http://www.swisseduc.ch/informatik/karatojava/javascriptkara/). JavaScriptKaraPlus enhances [JavaScriptKara from wi-wissen](https://github.com/wi-wissen/JavaScriptKara)

In contrast to the original JavaScriptKara itself is written in JavaScript and is under Mozilla Public License 2.0.
